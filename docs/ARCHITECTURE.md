# Architecture

llm-visuals is a single Rust binary built on [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) and
tokio. It has no agents inside the inference server: everything it shows is
polled over HTTP or read from `nvidia-smi`, then derived and smoothed locally.

Every inference server on the machine is watched at once. Each gets a
`ModelSlot` in the frame loop — its own `PerfTracker` and `FadeState` — and
its own HTTP poller. Samples carry the model's PID so the frame loop can route
them; the hardware collectors (`nvidia-smi`, `/proc`) stay shared, because the
GPUs and the disk are shared.

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `main.rs` | CLI parsing, terminal setup, the `ModelSlot` list, spawning one poller per model, routing samples by PID, the frame loop, key handling |
| `config.rs` | clap arguments and `ViewMode` |
| `settings.rs` | per-user config/data paths; loads `settings.json` and places its flags ahead of the command line; the settings screen's fields, keys, validation (re-parsing through clap) and saving |
| `dblog.rs` | `--log-db` SQLite writer (on by default at the per-user data path) with a size cap |
| `model_detect.rs` | finds inference processes via `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps` and `/proc`, parses their command lines (model path, port, ctx size, tensor split, spec mode); returns every server found, best first, minus this process and idle daemons |
| `vision.rs` | vision encoder detection and placement: llama.cpp projector flags and environment, the GPU runtime from `/proc/<pid>/maps`, and CUDA ordinal → host card via a `--cuda-bus-ids` child process that queries `libcuda` under the server's `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` / `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER` |
| `gguf.rs` | reads the GGUF header without loading tensors; maps layers to GPUs from `--tensor-split`; `read_tensor_summary` walks the tensor table and sizes each tensor from the gap to the next offset (no quant type table needed) |
| `observe.rs` | HTTP GET with timeouts; parsers for `/slots`, `/metrics` (Prometheus text) and `/experts` |
| `vllm.rs` | vLLM `/metrics` adapter: reconstructs per-request `LiveStats` from engine-wide Prometheus counters |
| `sglang.rs` | SGLang adapter: `GET /v1/loads?include=all` plus one-shot `/server_info`; optional `sglang:realtime_tokens_total` |
| `gpu.rs` | in-process NVML telemetry collector (falling back to `nvidia-smi` CSV) or Linux amdgpu sysfs on a `spawn_blocking` thread; smooth random-walk demo GPUs |
| `nvml.rs` | dynamically loads `nvml.dll` or `libnvidia-ml.so`; maintains a persistent in-process session for GPU metrics and PCIe throughput without subprocess overhead |
| `perf.rs` | turns counter samples into rates with `RateWindow` (sliding window), tracks requests, TTFT, peaks, MTP acceptance, history ring buffers; `Meter` (VU channel with peak hold and auto scale) and `BandwidthStats` for the pipeline view |
| `host.rs` | host counters: `/proc/diskstats`, `/proc/<pid>/io`, `/proc/<pid>/stat` (major faults), `/proc/<pid>/status` (`RssFile`), `/proc/meminfo`, and PCIe rx/tx per GPU via NVML `nvmlDeviceGetPcieThroughput` (with `nvidia-smi dmon` fallback). In-process NVML eliminates the repeated CLI subprocess spawns on the NVML path; the `dmon` fallback still spawns one per poll |
| `bandwidth.rs` | `weight_layout` (bytes total / active / CPU-side from the GGUF tensor table and VRAM use) and `assess`, the rule chain that names the bottleneck stage |
| `fade.rs` | time-based smoothing so the UI breathes: fast attack, slow release; per-expert heat that cools exponentially |
| `demo.rs` | synthetic servers (`--demo-models N`, each a prefill → decode → idle loop with its own profile) emitting `LiveStats`, `SpecMetrics` and `ExpertStats` through the same tagged channels; one extra task walks the shared GPUs and host counters from their combined load |
| `colors.rs` | truecolor / 256-colour gating, gradients, palette constants, themes |
| `render.rs` | the `Dashboard` view-model (every `ModelView` plus the focused index) and every panel; the models strip and comparison view walk all of them, the rest use the focused one; gauges, sparklines, big digits, layout rules |
| `pipeline.rs`, `llm/` | attention buffers for the optional Python transformers bridge (`--model <hf id>`) |

## Data contracts

**`/slots`** (always on in llama-server) gives per slot: `n_ctx`, `is_processing`,
`id_task`, `n_prompt_tokens`, `n_prompt_tokens_processed`, `n_prompt_tokens_cache`,
`next_token[0].n_decoded`, `params["speculative.types"]`. Rates are deltas of
these over `RateWindow`s; a request record starts when `id_task` changes or the
slot turns busy, and ends when it turns idle.

**`/metrics`** (needs `--metrics`) gives cumulative
`spec_decode_num_draft_tokens_total`, `spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens_total`,
`spec_decode_num_drafts_total`, `tokens_predicted_total`. Acceptance is the
windowed ratio of the first two.

**`/experts`** (needs the patch in `patches/`) gives per MoE layer the newest 16
routings and a 256-token histogram. See `patches/README.md`.

Each optional endpoint is probed at start and after a rescan; after three
failures that model's poller stops asking, so unpatched or older servers cost
nothing. The judgement is per model: a patched server next to an unpatched one
still gets its expert routing.

**SGLang `/v1/loads?include=all`** is always on. `decode_moments[5]` is
cumulative generated tokens, `decode_moments[0]` is decode/verify steps,
`total_prefill_uncached_tokens` is prefill, `num_used_tokens` is context
occupancy, `memory.weight_gb` / `memory.kv_cache_gb` are the real VRAM split.
There is no completion counter: a request starts on the idle→busy edge or
when `num_used_tokens` drops sharply while still busy. `/server_info` is
fetched once for `context_length` and `speculative_algorithm`. Speculative
acceptance is `generated − steps`, drafted tokens are
`steps × (num_draft_tokens − 1)`. The SGLang poller never runs faster than
400 ms (each GET is a uvicorn access-log line).

**HuggingFace `config.json`** (safetensors dirs, including nested
`text_config`) fills the same architecture fields as a GGUF header, so the
layers and experts panels work for vLLM and SGLang.

A rescan aborts every poller and starts fresh ones for what it finds. Slots
are matched to the new scan by PID, so a model that is still running keeps its
counters, history and request log, and one that has gone away stops being
polled immediately.

**Host counters** are cumulative, so `BandwidthStats::observe_host` takes
deltas over the poll interval. `nvidia-smi dmon` is already a rate (MB/s
over its own 1 s window) but occasionally prints a nonsense sample; anything
above the PCIe link cap (`pcie_link_mb_s(gen, width)`) is dropped.

**Weight streams** are estimates, labelled as such on screen:
`bytes_per_step = total − embedding − experts × (1 − used/total)`;
`cpu_bytes = file − Σ min(file × split share, VRAM used)`; RAM GB/s =
`cpu_bytes × active fraction × steps/s`, VRAM GB/s = the rest. Steps/s is
`spec.steps_per_sec` when `/metrics` is served, else decode tok/s; during
prefill it is `prefill tok/s ÷ ubatch`.

## Timing model

- Pollers run on their own tasks and push into bounded channels.
- The frame loop drains every channel, feeds `PerfTracker` and `FadeState`,
  builds a `Dashboard` of borrowed references, and renders. It sleeps ~33 ms.
- `FadeState::tick` uses wall-clock `dt`, so smoothing looks the same at any
  frame rate. Attack ≈ 180 ms, release ≈ 2.4 s for layer tiles; expert heat
  cools with τ = 0.6 s.
- `RateWindow` stores `(interval start, interval end, tokens)` so a rate is
  tokens over real elapsed time, including the first interval, and drops to
  zero within one window of the counter stopping.

## Rendering rules

- Colour comes from `colors::rgb`, which quantises to the xterm-256 cube when
  the terminal is not truecolor (auto-detected from `COLORTERM`, `TERM`,
  `TERM_PROGRAM`, VTE/Konsole markers; override with `--color`).
- Panels use rounded borders with an accent-coloured left title. A right-aligned
  border title is attached only if it cannot collide with the left one
  (`with_right`); otherwise the information moves into the body or is shed.
- Gauges have half-cell precision and an optional white peak-hold notch.
  The pipeline view's vertical meters (`vmeter`) use eighth-block precision,
  green at the foot to red at the top, with a `▔` peak line that holds 1.2 s
  and then falls at 40 % of scale per second.
- Sparklines are right-aligned in time (newest at the right edge) and coloured
  by level with a gradient.
- Layout sheds the models strip first (it needs 14 rows of body beneath it),
  then requests below 22 body rows and context/MTP below 16; the GPU line
  sheds PCIe, fan, clock, temperature before shrinking its gauge, and the key
  row shortens its own labels before dropping keys from the end.
- The models strip gives each row a fixed budget — index, name, phase and rate
  always survive — and spends what is left on history, then context, then
  VRAM, so every row's columns line up at any width.

## Testing

`cargo test` runs unit tests for every parser (real `nvidia-smi`, `/slots`,
`/metrics` and `/experts` samples), the rate window, request lifecycle, peak
hold, expert heat, colour quantisation, sparkline shapes and formatting. UI
layout is checked by running the binary in tmux and capturing panes; the
`docs/*.svg` screenshots are produced that way.
